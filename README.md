## Overview

Missed medical appointments can lead to inefficiencies and increased costs in healthcare. This project uses machine learning to predict patient no-shows, aiming to help clinics optimize scheduling and resource allocation. Special attention is given to reducing bias in the model.

## Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of patient appointment data
- Machine learning model to predict no-shows
- Bias mitigation techniques
- Easy-to-use Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks

## Dataset

- **File:** `patients.csv`
- **Description:** Contains anonymized patient appointment records with features such as age, gender, appointment date, and whether the patient showed up.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Patient-No-Show-prediction-.git
   cd Patient-No-Show-prediction-
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

- **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
  Open and run `eda.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook to explore the dataset.

- **Model Training and Evaluation:**
  Use `model.ipynb` to train and evaluate the machine learning model.

- **Run the Application:**
  If `app.py` is a script or web app, run:
  ```bash
  python app.py
  ```

## Results

- Model performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.) are available in `model.ipynb`.
- Bias analysis and mitigation results are discussed in the notebooks.
